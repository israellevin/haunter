Computer vision tricks for a haunted house installation.

Currently consists of a single python script for experimentation. Parameters are hard coded.

Without change, the script will search for the first video capture device and start capturing. Pressing the space bar will advance the script through the following modes in a loop.

# Show live mirror
# Record frames for ghost video
# Show live mirror
# Set base image (auto advances after a single frame)
# Haunting

Shift will start recording video to out.avi.
